Reverse-with-Recursion
======================

After completing the FizzBuzz program, I reminisced on the other task that I was presented during the job interview. To write a reversal function without using any of the prepackaged reverse functions in PHP. This I did not complete during the interview, but after I pondered on completing it by getting the parameter length then looping and popping and assigning the last character to a new variable. But wait...what about RECURSION?! Why not put some university education to practice?
